# DORA Metrics: How to Move from "Medium" to "Elite" Performer? 🚀

In the DevOps world, it's no longer enough to say your team is "fast." You have to prove it. Since 2014, the *State of DevOps* report by DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) has defined four key metrics that separate high-performing companies from the rest.

But once you have your numbers, how do you improve them? Here is your guide to transforming your performance and joining the exclusive circle of **Elite** teams.

## 📊 The 4 Performance Levels: Where Do You Stand?

Before climbing, you need to know where you're starting from. The DORA framework ranks companies into four categories: Low, Medium, High, and Elite.

| Metric | Medium Level | Elite Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deployment Frequency** | Between once per week and per month | Multiple times per day (On-demand) |
| **Lead Time for Changes** | Between one week and one month | Less than one hour |
| **Change Failure Rate** | 16% - 30% | 0% - 15% |
| **Time to Restore (MTTR)** | Between one day and one week | Less than one hour |

## 🛠 3 Concrete Levers to Reach the Next Level

### 1. Automate Everything That Can Be Automated
The main bottleneck for **Lead Time for Changes** is manual human intervention (endless code reviews, manual testing, manual deployment approvals). 
* **Action:** Implement an automated test suite triggered on every Pull Request. If your tests are reliable, your confidence grows, and your lead time drops.

### 2. Shrink Your Pull Request Size
The larger the change, the riskier and slower it is to review. Elite teams deploy small changes very frequently.
* **Action:** Break down your features into small, independent tasks. This radically improves your **Deployment Frequency** and reduces your **Change Failure Rate**.

### 3. Master Observability for Record-Breaking MTTR
To repair a service in less than an hour (**Time to Restore**), you need to know it's broken before your users do.
* **Action:** Integrate automated alerts on your GitHub workflows. Less time spent searching for the error means more time spent fixing it.

## 🎯 Why Measure Per Contributor?

Globally, your team might look performant, but bottlenecks can hide at the individual level (a developer stuck on a specific tech, a code review waiting too long). 

This is where **EasyDORA** comes in. By analyzing metrics per contributor, you aren't "policing" your team—you are **coaching** them. You identify who needs support to fluidify the global workflow.

## Conclusion: Start Measuring Today

You cannot improve what you do not measure. If you are flying blind, you will never know if your DevOps transformation efforts are actually paying off.

**Want to know if your team is "Elite"?** Stop wasting time with manual Excel sheets or digging through GitHub logs.
