# 🎉 New Super Cool Feature! 🎉

## What's New in Your App? (Version 2.0)

### 📊 The GitHub Activity Tab - Your New Best Friend!

Hey there, little developer! 👋

Remember when you look at your toys and count how many toy cars you have, how many are red, and how many are blue? Well, now your app can do the same thing with code projects!

---

## 🌟 What Did We Add?

We added a **brand new special tab** called **"GitHub Activity"**! 

Think of it like a **report card** for your code projects, but way more fun! It shows you:

### 📋 **Issues** (Like To-Do Lists!)
- **New Issues**: How many new things people want to fix or add (like adding new LEGO pieces to your castle!)
- **Closed Issues**: How many things got finished! ✅
- **Open Issues**: How many things are still waiting to be done
- **Issue Lead Time**: How long it takes to finish each thing (like how long it takes to build a LEGO set)

### 🔄 **Pull Requests** (Like Sharing Your Drawings!)
- **New PRs**: How many times people shared their new code
- **Merged PRs**: How many times the team said "Yes! That's great!" and added it
- **Closed PRs**: How many were decided not to use
- **Merge Rate**: A score showing how many get accepted (like gold stars! ⭐)
- **Time to Merge**: How long it takes for the team to say "yes!"

### 🔧 **Workflows** (Like Robot Helpers!)
- **Total Runs**: How many times the robot helpers ran tests
- **Successful Runs**: How many times everything worked perfectly! 🎯
- **Success Rate**: A score showing how often things work right
- **Duration**: How long the robots take to check everything

## 🎮 How to Use It (Super Easy!)

### Step 1: Open Your App 🖥️
Just like opening a game on your tablet!

### Step 2: Pick a Project 🎯
Choose which code project you want to look at (like picking which toy box to play with)

### Step 3: Click "Calculate Metrics" 🔢
This is like asking the app to count everything for you! 
*Remember: You need to do this first, just like charging a toy before playing with it!*

### Step 4: Click the "GitHub Activity" Tab 🎨
Look at the top! You'll see buttons:
- DORA Metrics
- **GitHub Activity** ← Click this one!
- By Contributor
- Launched Tasks

### Step 5: See All the Cool Numbers! 🌈
Now you can see:
- Pretty colored boxes with big numbers
- Three sections with different colors:
  - 💚 **Green boxes** = Issues stuff
  - 💗 **Pink boxes** = Pull Request stuff
  - 💛 **Yellow boxes** = Robot helper stuff

---

## 🎨 What Makes It Special?

✨ **Pretty Colors**: Each section has its own special colors, like your crayon box!

📊 **Big Numbers**: Easy to read, just like counting on your fingers!

🎯 **Three Groups**: Everything is organized nicely, like putting toys in different boxes!

⚡ **Super Fast**: Just click and see! No waiting!

---

## 🤔 Why Is This Cool?

Imagine you're building with blocks with your friends. Wouldn't it be cool to know:
- How many blocks everyone added today? 🧱
- How many towers got finished? 🏰
- How many times you had to rebuild because something fell? 🔄

That's exactly what this does... but for computer code instead of blocks!

---

## 🎁 Special Features

### Works Like Magic! ✨
- You don't need to do anything special
- When you calculate your DORA metrics, this calculates too!
- It's like getting a bonus prize! 🎁

### Works for All Projects! 🌍
- Big projects
- Small projects
- Projects with lots of people
- Projects with just a few people

### No Mistakes! 🛡️
- If a project doesn't have robot helpers (workflows), the app just shows zeros
- It doesn't break or crash - it's super safe!
